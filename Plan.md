Acknowledgements: Much of the idea for creating a data services plan came from a workshop from the Inter-University Consortium for Political and Social Research in Providing Social Science Data Services: Strategies for Design and Operation. 
Also, a framework for developing this plan was largely based on chapter 10 of “Data Basics: An Introductory Text” by Geraci, D., Humphrey, C., and Jacobs, J.
